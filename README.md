🎯 Project Title: CollegeClub – Event Management Portal for Students
📌 Theme:
Developing a lightweight application to help students easily discover and access upcoming college events, while also providing smaller institutions with a simple internal tool to manage event data effectively.

📝 Project Description:
CampusConnect is a user-friendly web application designed to bridge the gap between students and the various academic, cultural, and technical events happening in their institutions. Many small colleges and student clubs struggle with event management due to a lack of robust internal tools and technical infrastructure. This application offers a centralized platform that allows event organizers to post upcoming events, and students to explore and register for them with ease.

🔍 Key Features:
📅 Upcoming Events Display: A clean, card-based interface showing all upcoming events with images, brief descriptions, and a register button.

🔍 Event Details View: Clicking on a card gives full event information like time, venue, description, and team contacts.

📝 Registration Links: Direct links for students to register or get redirected to external forms (like EventEye, Google Forms, etc.).

📊 Internal Management: Simple JavaScript-based admin functions for small colleges to add or manage event data dynamically without server-side setup.

💡 Mobile Responsive Design: Accessible across devices, especially for students who prefer mobile browsing.

🧑‍💻 Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Optional Tools: Bootstrap for UI components, Google Sheets for backend-free data storage

No Server Required: Fully static application, can be hosted on GitHub Pages or any shared hosting

🎯 Why This Project?
In many colleges, especially smaller ones, communication about events is often scattered—via posters, WhatsApp groups, or word of mouth. Students miss out on opportunities simply due to lack of centralized information. This project addresses that problem by offering:

A central hub for all events

A scalable and low-tech solution colleges can easily maintain

A student-focused UI that's easy to navigate and visually appealing
